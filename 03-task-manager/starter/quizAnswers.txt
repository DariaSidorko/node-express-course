1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

    Middleware functions in Express are functions that have access to the request and response 
    objects, and the next function in the application's request-response cycle.  Middleware 
    functions can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, etc.

2. What does CRUD stand for?

    CRUD stands for Create(Adding new data), Read(Retrieving existing data), 
    Update(Modifying existing data), Delete(Removing existing data).

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?

        To access variables from the .env file in your Node.js application, 
        you can use the dotenv package.
   
        require('dotenv').config();
    
        After configuring dotenv, you can access your environment variables anywhere 
        in your application using process.env.VARIABLE_NAME. For example:
    
        const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
        const dbPassword = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;

    2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github 
repository?

        Add .env to .gitignore
